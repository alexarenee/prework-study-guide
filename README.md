## Description

My motivation for building this project is to help student keep track of all the notes the collect throughout the bootcamp.
I built this program as a resource for students who want to stay on top of the information they receive during this course.
This project keeps students organized and reduces stress.
I learned that projects like these are essential to students success throughout the course of this bootcamp.
